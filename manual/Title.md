# Welcome to COSMIIC!

We are establishing and sustaining an open source, modular network of active implantable devices for use in fundamental neuroscience, animal, and early feasibility human research. Our open source concept includes all aspects of the implantable system that are necessary for pre-clinical and human use: hardware, software, mechanical components, test documents, regulatory documents, and instruction manuals.

The COSMIIC concept is based on an existing platform implantable system, the [Networked Neuroprosthetic (NNP)](https://fescenter.org/research/technology-programs/networked-neuroprosthetic-nnp-system/) System, which was invented and developed at Case Western Reserve University by the investigative team. The first incarnation of the NNP System has already been developed with success demonstrated by an early feasibility human study, providing a strong existence-proof of the basic concept. Our goal with establishing COSMIIC is to make this system available to the entire research community in an open source, collaborative environment.

# Introduction
This website contains documentation relating to the [NNP Generic Remote Module](https://github.com/COSMIIC-Inc/Implantables-GenericModule-Application) code repository. The generic module implements a minumum set of features that enables interoperability within the NNP network.

Contributors can add additional functionality to their devices to create new modules for use within the network. Check out the [How To Use](How To Use.md) page for information on adding and configuring module functionality.

# Supported Boards
The generic remote module codebase was created with the use of the [Evaluation Board](https://docs.cosmiic.org/Getting-Started/Eval-Board) in mind, ```[based on the STM32L433 microcontroller]```. The codebase was written with the use of the STM32 Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) and CMSIS, which allows for translation to other STM32 series microcontrollers.
